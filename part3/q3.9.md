**3.9 Why I can not getUnitManager call?**

---

All ofActivity classes in project need to inherit either ‘BindBaseActivity’ class or ‘TopBaseActivity’ class. ‘TopBaseActivity’ class is the subclass of ‘BindBaseActivity’ class.



Example :

publicclassMainActivityextendsTopBaseActivity{

....

}





Note:

You can refer to our SDK documentation \(v1.1.8\) Chapter 3.1.1 Inheritance Classes of Activity Introduction for more detailed instruction.
