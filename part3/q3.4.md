**3.4 Where should I put AAR file into my project?**

---

```
Copy and paste ‘QihanOpenSDK\_1.1.8.0.aar’ and ‘gson-2.2.4.jar’ into the folder ‘libs’ which is under ‘Module’ folder. Here is an example screenshot below that I copy and paste AAR file to my APP “FrankTest” lib folder.
```

2.Adding following content into ‘build.gradle’ folder

under‘APP Module’.

repositories{  
flatDir{  
dirs'libs'  
}  
 }  
 dependencies{  
compile\(name:'QihanOpenSdk\_1.1.8.0',ext:'aar'\)  
}
